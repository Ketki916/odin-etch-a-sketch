# odin-etch-a-sketch

This code is developed for a project assigned by the Odin Project to simulate a basic etch-a-sketch pad.

Hover mouse over the grid to draw.

The default grid size for the sketchpad is 16 x 16 squares. To set a new grid size and reset the sketchpad, click button at the top. Please limit the grid size to 100 x 100, else it will default back to 16 x 16 squares.
